# Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.

## Sass
### O que é Sass? 
SASS (Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets), um pré-processador de CSS que oferece recursos adicionais e facilita a organização e manutençãodos estilos
em uma aplicação web. O SASS permite criar variáveis, classes aninhadas, particionar arquivos e importar estilos e variáveis de forma mais fácil.

## Variáveis
### O que é variáveis? 
Variáveis em Sass (Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets) são usadas para armazenar valores que você deseja reutilizar em seu código CSS. Elas são declaradas com o prefixo $ seguido de um nome de variável e um valor. As variáveis facilitam a manutenção do código, pois permitem que você defina um valor em um único lugar e o use em vários locais dentro do seu arquivo Sass
